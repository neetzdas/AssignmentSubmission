		    <p>Neetu Das is a student. She was born in Janakpur in 26 October, 1998 A.D. She is currently living in Tinthana, Kathmandu. She spent her childhood in Kathmandu. She has passed her SLC from Sundarban School of Science and completed her +2 in United Academy. She is currently studying BSc Computing in Nami College. She is hard-working, an aspirant learner and developer. She likes reading books, stories, playing badminton and dancing. She is a simple girl with millions of dreams in her eyes. She has chosen her career in IT. IT is evolutionary and rapidly progressive which helps to learn new things everyday and so does Neetu want to learn as a developer. She thinks once you know what success looks like for you, you get the path to it. We learn through our mistakes so make mistakes as much as you can rather than doing nothing. She is on the path to accomplish her dreams on her own through her devotion, effort and hardwork. She is focused to achieve her goal.</p>
